Swarm-inspired algorithms and methods have proven effective in solving complex optimization problems and creating multi-robot and networked systems of unparalleled resilience, adaptability and scalability. Applications of swarm intelligence continue to grow and become increasingly critical for addressing societal challenges such as environmental sustainability, food security, health, and global conflicts."

While control theory has been firmly rooted in the tradition of model-based design, the availability and scale of data (both temporal and spatial) will require rethinking the foundations of the discipline. From a machine learning perspective, one of the main challenges going forward is to go beyond pattern recognition and address problems in data-driven control and optimization of dynamical processes. Our conference has been building a new community of people who think rigorously across the disciplines, ask new questions, and develop the foundations of this new scientific area."

    "note": "BioRob delves into both theoretical and practical challenges arising from the integration of robotics and mechatronics into medicine and biology. The main objective of Biorobotics is to evaluate biological systems through a ‘biomechatronic’ lens, striving to unravel the scientific and engineering principles that underpin their exceptional performance. This deep comprehension of biological system functions, behaviors, and interactions serves two primary purposes: to inform the design and creation of new, high-performance bio-inspired machinery and systems for various applications, and to foster the development of innovative nano-, micro-, and macro-devices that can act upon, replace, or assist human beings in areas such as disease prevention, diagnostics, surgical procedures, prosthetics, rehabilitation, and personal assistance."

With over 3 decades of history, more than 3.800 systems installed worldwide, and over 600.000 robot-assisted interventions conducted per year, the field of robotic surgery is well-established. Despite these impressive figures and increasing popularity in research labs all over the world, the list of technological advances that made it into the operating room (OR) during this last decade remains limited. Long-awaited techniques such as 3D reconstruction, motion compensation, virtual guidance, haptic feedback, understudy in many labs all over the planet did not make their appearance into the market yet. CRAS strives to overcome this status-quo by strengthening the collaboration between the different research groups to boost the efficacy and shorten the development cycle."
