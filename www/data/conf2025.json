While control theory has been firmly rooted in the tradition of model-based design, the availability and scale of data (both temporal and spatial) will require rethinking the foundations of our discipline. From a machine learning perspective, one of the main challenges going forward is to go beyond pattern recognition and address problems in data-driven control and optimization of dynamical processes. Our overall goal is to create a new community of people who think rigorously across the disciplines, ask new questions, and develop the foundations of this new scientific area.

We envision a hybrid intelligence where robots and humans together will be more able, effective, productive, efficient, and fun to work with. To realize a successful integration of these socially interactive robots into our society, we need to invest in a future where human-robot teams could become prevalent. To this end, we need to create a clear vision of this future and create innovations related to interaction models, social capabilities, and the skills of these robots to understand how they can work together with us."

Emotivation captures the synergy between emotion and motivation, where emotions trigger and sustain motivation during interactions. In social robotics, this concept is key to building trust, fostering empathy, and supporting decision-making by enabling robots to respond sensitively to human emotions, inspiring engagement and action. For this year\u2019s edition, we are excited to introduce several new elements designed to enhance your experience and enrich the discussions."
