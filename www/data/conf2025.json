While control theory has been firmly rooted in the tradition of model-based design, the availability and scale of data (both temporal and spatial) will require rethinking the foundations of our discipline. From a machine learning perspective, one of the main challenges going forward is to go beyond pattern recognition and address problems in data-driven control and optimization of dynamical processes. Our overall goal is to create a new community of people who think rigorously across the disciplines, ask new questions, and develop the foundations of this new scientific area.

We envision a hybrid intelligence where robots and humans together will be more able, effective, productive, efficient, and fun to work with. To realize a successful integration of these socially interactive robots into our society, we need to invest in a future where human-robot teams could become prevalent. To this end, we need to create a clear vision of this future and create innovations related to interaction models, social capabilities, and the skills of these robots to understand how they can work together with us."
